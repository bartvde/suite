A tour of Composer
==================

This section will introduce the Composer interface.

.. note:: Composer is only available with `OpenGeo Suite Enterprise <http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/opengeo-suite/>`_. For more information on OpenGeo Suite Enterprise, please `contact us <http://boundlessgeo.com/about/contact-us/sales/>`_.

The Composer interface consists of two main sections:

* :ref:`Configuration <webmaps.composer.configuration>` 
* :ref:`Style Editor <webmaps.composer.styleview>`

The Configuration pages regard the composition of maps, the availability of layers, and the data that comprises them. The Style Editor page provides an interface for viewing and styling layers and maps, with the view updating in real-time.

Login
-----

Because of the ability to make low-level configuration changes to GeoServer, **access to Composer is only granted to users with administrative rights to GeoServer**.

   Login page for Composer

Enter an administrative user name and password and click :guilabel:`Login` to access Composer. When you first log in, you will be in the Configuration section.

.. note:: The default GeoServer administrator credentials are ``admin`` / ``geoserver``.

Home page / Recent
------------------

This page is shown when first logging in to Composer. It contains a list of recently accessed resources (if any), and also includes a three-step section on :guilabel:`Getting Started with Composer`.

.. note:: See the :ref:`webmaps.composer.tutorial` for more details on the Composer workflow.

Toolbar
-------

When logged in, the top of the application will always contain three links:

* **Home**, accessible by clicking the :guilabel:`Composer` logo
* **Help**, to bring up this documentation
* **User settings**, with links to the GeoServer Admin interface and to logout

.. todo:: Add figure

Navigation panel
----------------

All Configuration pages contain the same Navigation panel on the left side of the screen. This panel contains the following options:

* :guilabel:`New` menu: Creates a new project workspace.
* :guilabel:`Project Workspaces`: Lists all project workspaces available on the server. If the screen size is small, or if the list of project workspaces is large, a :guilabel:`More` link will appear, which will take you to the :guilabel:`All Project Workspaces` page.

   * Within each project workspace listing, there are individual links to view the list of that project workspace's :guilabel:`Maps`, :guilabel:`Layers`, and :guilabel:`Data`.

* :guilabel:`All Maps`: Lists all maps in all project workspaces.
* :guilabel:`All Layers`: Lists all published layers
* :guilabel:`Recent`: Shows all recently accessed resources.

The Navigation panel can be collapsed and expanded by clicking the arrow at the top of the panel. While collapsed, all of the functionality is still available.

Terminology
-----------

In order to simplify map-making for those new to the tools, some of the terms used in Composer may be different from what you are used to. The following table may make using Composer easier:

.. list-table::

   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Term
